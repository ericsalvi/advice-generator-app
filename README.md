- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- Axios
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I actually learned a neat little trick from @maiaflow about box shadows. Typically I'll use a generator and try to get it looking just right from the beginning. She taught me that you should set your offset first without any blur or spread that way you can easily see the poisition of the shadow. Then once it is in the right area, you can set your spread/blur. Made the box shadow on this component area super easy to implement.
